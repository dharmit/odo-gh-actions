One such feature of odo that we will discuss in this guide is creation of Kubernetes resources like Pods, Deployments, Services (Kubernetes Services, not the Operator backed ones) and such using odo. Using this, if an advanced user would like to create some Kubernetes resources, they could edit the devfile.yaml and add it there. An odo push after the edit would create the resource on the cluster. A resource thus created would co-exist with an odo component.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorials/debugging-using-devfile":{"id":"tutorials/debugging-using-devfile","title":"Debugging using devfile","description":"Debugging a component","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorials/deploying-a-devfile-using-odo-on-IBM-Z-and-Power":{"id":"tutorials/deploying-a-devfile-using-odo-on-IBM-Z-and-Power","title":"Using odo on IBM-Z and Power","description":"[//]: # (Add prerequisite section)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorials/deploying-java-app-with-database":{"id":"tutorials/deploying-java-app-with-database","title":"Deploying a Java Open Liberty application with PostgreSQL","description":"This tutorial illustrates deploying a Java Open Liberty application with odo and linking it to an in-cluster PostgreSQL service in a minikube environment.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"tutorials/using-devfile-lifecycle-events":{"id":"tutorials/using-devfile-lifecycle-events","title":"Using devfile lifecycle events","description":"odo uses devfile to build and deploy components.
